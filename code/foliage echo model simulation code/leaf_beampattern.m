% This code is to describe the scattering of the leaves
% Inputs: frequency of incoming wave from the sonar, frq 60~80 (kHz)
%         radius of the leaf, a
%         incident angle, theta0, in radians
%         the number of bins between 60~80kHz, no_bins
% Outputs: 
%          amplitude of the leaf beampattern, leaf_amp
%          phase of the leaf beampattern, leaf_phase
