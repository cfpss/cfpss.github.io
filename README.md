## A Computational Framework for Parsimonious Sonar Sensing

This project will develop a computational approach to advance the discovery and understanding of parsimonious sonar sensing in complex environments. The researchers will perform large-scale simulations to generate densely vegetated environments and vegetation echoes; develop novel statistical models to extract echo signatures and learn their relation to environmental parameters and design dynamic algorithms for sensing and navigation. This computational approach provides enabling tools--validated using simulated and experimental data--to advance the community's ability to develop adaptive models for various sensing scenarios and enable novel sensing paradigms. 

The aim of this Github page is to make open source the developed software simulation algorithms and algorithms for sensing and navigation in Virginia Tech. In addition, the conceptual framework articles will also be available soon.
